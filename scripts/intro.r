intro1 <- "Facebook has more data on us than many could ever imagine, the 
Cambridge Analytic scandal was an example of what is possible using this 
data. Many were outraged by sharing of data but most do not realize that 
Facebook hasn't stopped sharing your data with third parties and political 
advertisers. Facebook allows advertisers to advertise to you based on a 
very specific profile of you including your demographics, location, and 
political orientation. The Facebook Political Ads Simulator was built to 
illustrate what this looks like."

intro2 <- "This project uses a dataset of over 100,000 real 
Facebook political ads collected by ProPublica along with the \"Why am I 
seeing this?\" disclosure on each ad that shares the target of the ads. 
Using this, the Facebook Political Ads Simulator recreates how Facebook 
would target specific users, allowing you to explore the different types 
of ads shown to different types of people. For example, you can see the 
difference between a young Democrat in California and an older Republican 
from Texas under the \"Sample Users\" tab. After that, explore the ads even 
more by visiting the \"Custom User\" tab where you can see ads targeted 
towards any user group you would like. Try putting in your information to 
see what would be targeted at you. You can also put in information very 
different than your own and get a peek at ads that would likely never be 
shown to you on your actual Facebook."
